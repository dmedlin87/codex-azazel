## 1. Biblical Occurrences

### Masoretic Text

The Hebrew term **עֲזָאזֵל** (*ʿăzāzēl*) appears **exactly 4 times**, all in Leviticus 16:

| Verse | Hebrew Context | Translation |
|-------|----------------|-------------|
| **Lev 16:8** | גּוֹרָל אֶחָד לַיהוָה וְגוֹרָל אֶחָד לַעֲזָאזֵל | "One lot for YHWH and one lot for Azazel" |
| **Lev 16:10** | הַשָּׂעִיר אֲשֶׁר־עָלָה עָלָיו הַגּוֹרָל לַעֲזָאזֵל | "The goat on which the lot fell for Azazel" |
| **Lev 16:26** | וְהַמְשַׁלֵּחַ אֶת־הַשָּׂעִיר לַעֲזָאזֵל | "And he who releases the goat for Azazel" |
| **Lev 16:21-22** | ...וְשִׁלַּח בְּיַד־אִישׁ עִתִּי הַמִּדְבָּרָה. וְנָשָׂא הַשָּׂעִיר עָלָיו אֶת־כָּל־עֲוֺנֹתָם אֶל־אֶרֶץ גְּזֵרָה | "...and send [the goat] by the hand of a man who is ready into the wilderness. The goat shall bear all their iniquities to an inaccessible land" |

**Key Observations**:

- Always used with preposition ל (*la-*, "for" or "to")
- Parallel structure: *la-YHWH* :: *la-ʿăzāzēl* strongly suggests two **recipients** or **destinations**
- The goat is sent *to* Azazel into the wilderness, not simply "sent away"
- Hapax legomenon (unique to this passage in Hebrew Bible)

## 2. Ancient Translations

| Translation | Date | Rendering | Interpretation |
|-------------|------|-----------|----------------|
| **Septuagint (LXX)** | ~3rd cent. BCE | ἀποπομπαῖος (*apopompaios*) | "Sender-away," "averter" — **functional reading** |
| **Vulgate** | ~4th cent. CE | *caper emissarius* | "Emissary goat," "scapegoat" — **functional reading** |
| **Peshitta (Syriac)** | ~2nd-3rd cent. CE | ܥܙܐܙܝܠ (*ʿZazazel*) or ܥܙܐܙܐܝܠ | **Transliteration** — preserves as proper name |
| **Targum Onkelos** | ~2nd-3rd cent. CE | לַעֲזָאזֵל (*la-ʿazazel*) | **Transliteration** — preserves Hebrew |
| **Targum Pseudo-Jonathan** | ~7th-8th cent. CE | לְעַזָּאזֵל (*le-ʿazzazel*), identified with Azazel/Uzza | **Personal name** — demon in the wilderness |
| **Aquila** | ~2nd cent. CE | ἀποπομπή (*apopompē*) | "Dismissal," "sending away" — **functional** |
| **Symmachus** | ~2nd cent. CE | τράγος ἀποπομπαῖος (*tragos apopompaios*) | "Goat that is sent away" — **functional** |

**Key Observation**: Early Greek and Latin favor **functional** readings ("sender-away," "scapegoat"), while Semitic versions (Peshitta, Targums) tend toward **transliteration** or **personal name**.

## 3. Etymological Proposals

### Option 1: Functional Compound

**Proposal**: עֵז (*ʿēz*, "goat") + אָזַל (*ʾāzal*, "go away") = **"goat that goes away"** or **"scapegoat"**

**Arguments For**:

- Fits ritual function: goat literally goes away into wilderness
- Simple, non-mythological reading
- Aligns with LXX/Vulgate functional translations

**Arguments Against**:

- Morphology awkward: expected form would be *ʿēz ʾōzelet* or similar, not *ʿăzāzēl*
- Parallel syntax (*la-YHWH* :: *la-ʿăzāzēl*) suggests proper name, not description
- If merely functional, why not use clear term like *midbār* ("wilderness") or *gērāʾ* ("sent away")?

**Verdict**: Linguistically **weak**; contextually **plausible but not compelling**

---

### Option 2: Geographical/Physical Term

**Proposal**: From root עָזַז (*ʿāzaz*, "strong," "harsh," "rugged") = **"rough ground,"** **"precipice,"** or **"rocky wilderness"**

**Arguments For**:

- Fits wilderness setting in Lev 16:21-22 ("inaccessible land")
- Avoids demonology, preserving P's monotheistic scruples
- Some Targumic and rabbinic support (e.g., "hard/rough place")

**Arguments Against**:

- No other biblical use of *ʿzz* root in this geographic sense
- Why use obscure term instead of common *midbār*, *ṣiyyāh*, or *ʾereṣ gězērāh*?
- Doesn't explain why goat is sent *to* (ל) Azazel rather than *toward* (אֶל) or *into* (בְּ) a place

**Verdict**: **Possible** but lacks strong comparative evidence; feels like rationalization

---

### Option 3: Demonological/Theophoric Proper Name

**Proposal**: עָזַז (*ʿāzaz*, "strong," "fierce") + אֵל (*ʾēl*, "god" or "power") = **"fierce god,"** **"strong power,"** or **"god of strength"**

**Arguments For**:

- Morphologically plausible theophoric pattern (cf. *ʿAzāzʾēl* in 1 Enoch)
- Parallel syntax (*la-YHWH* :: *la-ʿăzāzēl*) strongly suggests two personal recipients
- Goat sent *to Azazel* in wilderness implies **destination with agency**, not mere geography
- Second Temple reception (1 Enoch, Apocalypse of Abraham, Qumran) consistently treats Azazel as **personal entity**
- Fits ANE elimination ritual pattern where impurity is sent to **wilderness powers** or **netherworld**

**Arguments Against**:

- P's monotheistic theology typically avoids naming or empowering demons
- Why would P tolerate dual recipients (YHWH and demon) in sacred ritual?
- Could be later re-mythologization: Torah term is neutral, Second Temple texts impose demonology

**Verdict**: **Most plausible** given syntax and reception history, but **not decisive**

## 4. Comparative ANE Context

### Elimination Rituals in Ancient Near East

Similar rituals in other cultures involve sending impurity to wilderness or netherworld:

| Culture | Ritual | Destination | Agent |
|---------|--------|-------------|-------|
| **Hittite** | *šalli(ya)-* rite | Wilderness, netherworld | Demons, death gods |
| **Ebla** | Scapegoat ritual | Desert, "place of no return" | Underworld powers |
| **Mesopotamia** | *namburbi* exorcism | River, steppe, ruins | Demons (*utukku*, *gallû*) |
| **Ugarit** | Animal expulsion | Sea, wilderness | Mot (death god), Yamm (sea) |

**Key Pattern**: Impurity is **physically transferred** to animal/object and **spatially expelled** to liminal space associated with **malevolent powers**.

**Implication for Azazel**: If Lev 16 follows this pattern, Azazel is likely the **wilderness power** receiving (or at least associated with) the expelled impurity.

**Caution**: Structural parallels ≠ name borrowing. We cannot assume Azazel = Mot or specific ANE deity without direct evidence.

## 5. Reception History Summary

| Period | Tradition | Azazel Identified As |
|--------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Torah (P)** | Levitical ritual | Opaque term; possible wilderness power (demythologized) |
| **Second Temple** | 1 Enoch, Qumran, Apoc. Abraham | Fallen Watcher, arch-demon, origin of sin |
| **Rabbinic Rationalist** | Talmud, Maimonides | Geographical term, symbolic process, pedagogical device |
| **Rabbinic Mystical** | Zohar, Nachmanides, Targums | Samael/demon receiving ritual "bribe" to prevent accusation |
| **Christian Patristic** | Barnabas, Origen, Tertullian | Type of Satan (recipient of sin) OR type of Christ (sin-bearer) |
| **Medieval Christian** | Commentators, scholastics | Often merged with Satan/Belial |

**Observation**: The **demonological interpretation dominates post-Torah reception**, even among traditions (rationalist rabbinic, patristic) that attempt demythologization.

## 6. Scholarly Positions (Modern)

### Scholarly Consensus?

**There is no consensus.** Major lexica and commentaries present multiple options:

| Source | Position |
|--------|----------|
| **HALOT** (*Hebrew and Aramaic Lexicon*) | Lists all three options; notes uncertainty |
| **BDB** (*Brown-Driver-Briggs*) | Prefers "entire removal" (functional), acknowledges demon theory |
| **TDOT** (*Theological Dictionary of OT*) | Discusses demon, place, and functional readings; no firm conclusion |
| **Milgrom** (*Leviticus 1-16*, Anchor Bible) | Favors **demon/wilderness power** based on syntax and ANE parallels |
| **Knohl** (*Sanctuary of Silence*) | Treats as **archaic elimination rite** with probable demonological roots |
| **Douglas** (*Purity and Danger*) | Functional/symbolic reading; Azazel = "total removal" concept |
| **Wright** (*Disposal of Impurity*) | Argues for **wilderness demon**, but notes P's demythologization |
| **Olyan** (*Rites and Rank*) | Sees **non-theistic power**, not personal demon |

**Current Scholarly Distribution** (rough estimate):

- **Demonological/Wilderness Power**: ~50-60% (most common in technical commentaries)
- **Geographical/Functional**: ~30-40% (more common in popularizing works)
- **Explicitly Agnostic**: ~10-20% (scholars who flag it as unresolvable)

## 7. Stability Assessment

### Certainty Level: ⚠️ **CONTESTED**

**What We Know**:

- עֲזָאזֵל is hapax legomenon in MT
- Appears 4x in Lev 16 in ritual context
- Parallel syntax (*la-YHWH* :: *la-ʿăzāzēl*) favors proper name or personal destination
- Ancient translations divided: functional (Greek/Latin) vs. personal name (Syriac/Aramaic)
- Post-Torah reception overwhelmingly treats Azazel as personal entity

**What We Don't Know**:

- **Etymology is genuinely uncertain**
- Original meaning in pre-P ritual (if any) is lost
- Whether P intended personal name, place name, or functional term
- How Lev 16 relates to Lev 17:7's *se'irim* (goat-demons) ban

**Best Working Hypothesis**:
Azazel in Leviticus 16 **most likely** represents a **wilderness power or domain** whose demonological features have been **muted** by Priestly editors. The ritual logic preserves an elimination structure found across ANE, but P avoids explicit mythological narrative.

**Credence**: ~65% for demonological reading, ~30% for geographical, ~5% for pure functional

**Methodological Principle**: Any argument that depends on a specific etymology of *ʿăzāzēl* should be **flagged as uncertain** and **alternative readings acknowledged**.
